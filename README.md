# Treasure2 Jewelry

![](./Treasure2-1.12.2/src/resources/treasure2-github-logo.png)

This is a minimal version of Treasure2 with JUST the jewelry items.

No world gen, no treasure, no locks/keys, no gems, no recipes, no runestones.

Jewelry will be enchantable only via normal enchanting methods, no charming table.
